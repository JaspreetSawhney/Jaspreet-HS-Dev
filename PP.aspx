            <strong>Personal Data:</strong> We collect personal data from you, the user, when you voluntarily
            choose to register with HAIRSLAYER. We use the personal data that we collect in
            order to provide and improve our services, and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy
            Policy and in our Terms of Service. Examples of personal data include first name,
            last name, address, email address, telephone number, birth date, billing and credit
            card information.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Third Party Personal Data:</strong> We also collect personal data from you, the user, about
            certain third party individuals, including but not limited to your clients. We use
            this personal data that we collect from you in order to provide and improve our
            services, facilitate communication between you and such third parties, and as otherwise
            set forth in this Privacy Policy and in our Terms of Service. You warrant to HAIRSLAYER
            that any personal data you provide us about any third party individuals was obtained
            by you with full consent from such third party, and that such third party has not
            communicated to you that they wish to opt out of receiving communication from HAIRSLAYER.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Use of Personal Data:</strong> HAIRSLAYER uses the personal data you provide in a manner
            that is consistent with this Privacy Policy or with any applicable service-specific
            agreement. If you provide personal data for a certain reason, we may use the personal
            data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, we will
            use the personal data you input during the registration process to administer access
            to the Website. We may also use the client information you submit to send them an
            email or SMS messages when you take action via the site to do so. We may also contact
            your clients to tell them about products and services you offer for the purpose
            of promoting your business as part of our Service. We will notify you of the intent
            to send these communications beforehand and give you the ability to opt out. We
            will also give your clients the opportunity to opt out of receiving communications
            from HAIRSLAYER. HAIRSLAYER and its affiliates also use you and your clients' personal
            data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Website
            to help us improve the content and functionality of the Website, to better understand
            the users of our Website, and to improve our services.</p>

            rendered.</strong></p>
        <p>

            information from you at the time of registration, or when you choose to use certain
            of our services. This information is not, by itself, sufficient to identify or contact
            you or your clients. Examples include demographic data, age, education level, profession,

            may share this aggregate data with our affiliates, agents and business partners.
            We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services
            to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other
            lawful purposes.</p>
